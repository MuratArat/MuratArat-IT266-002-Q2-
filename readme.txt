This mod will be b a basic combat replacer that makes quake 2 into a boxing game. I want to make 2 weapons one for light and one for heavy attacks. The fights will be cut into rounds and in between rounds both partyâ€™s regenerate stamina and health. I want to implement dodging. Enemy spawn 1 at a time.

Final Deliverables: 
- Boxing attacks (L/R mouse Movement) with jabs, hooks, uppercuts, etc (at least 5 attacks per arm)
- Stats that can be customized 
- Blocks and Dodges for enemy actions 
-  Opponent Boxer to do said actions 
- Round Based combat
